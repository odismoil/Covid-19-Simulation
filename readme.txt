The code file is pretty self-explanatory: I added lots of comments. Here I want to add some additional notes
The code cocnsist of two parts: first part contains only functions and no simulation happens there; second part
makes use of the functions in part 1 to run 7 different simulations.The code is very long and please refer to my
report in case something is unclear. 

The code takes extremely long to run ~8-10 hours or more, but I guarantee that it runs succesfully. 

Graph of active cases vs time is produces. Active cases vs is given in saparate file as well.
